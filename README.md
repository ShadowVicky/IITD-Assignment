# IITD-Assignment
## DINO-DETR Pedestrian Detection On Custom Dataset
Pedestrian Detection on Custom Dataset using an Attention Based Transformer Technique. Assignments includes visualizations of intermediate layers, sampling points of the best query and fine-tuning apart from regular inference.

# DINO
This is a standalone notebook of the paper "DINO: DETR with Improved DeNoising Anchor Boxes for End-to-End Object Detection".

## Checkpoints available here:


We have put our model checkpoints here:
- [Model zoo in Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/your-link-here)
- [Model zoo in 百度网盘](https://pan.baidu.com/your-link-here)（提取码 "DINO"）

Where `checkpoint{x}_{y}scale.pth` denotes the checkpoint of y-scale model trained for x epochs.
